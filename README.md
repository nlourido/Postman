Postman Collections

# DNA Center
The DNA Center Postman Collection is a work-in-progress. Currently, the uploaded version only supports 1.2.5 or higher of DNA Center.

Future Plans:
Add all available API requests

# vCenter REST API
A very basic collection to run basic GET requests against the vCenter REST API and then create a VM from a template in a library and use guest customization. 

Future Plans:
Create API requests utilzing Postman "Tests" to automate processes like cloning/creating VMs from templates.
